# image_generator_server
 
This project is a full-stack web app project that categorizes preloaded images into different themes, colors and mood and allowing the user to choose and save to their favorites page, just like a Pinterest page. The project uses Node.js and React framework for the front end web UI. This is the server part of the web app. The server stores all the image data within a MongoDB database and fetches the information of the images for the front end according to what is being selected in the front end UI.
